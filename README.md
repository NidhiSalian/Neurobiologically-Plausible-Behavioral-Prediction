# Neurobiologically-Plausible-Behavioral-Prediction
A model of mixed neural networks for step-by-step processing of dynamic visual scenes, activity recognition and behavioral prediciton

Based on Ongoing Research Work.

Code, datasets and models to be uploaded soon. 

##Pre-Requisites 

If you're working with Python for Deep Learning on Windows and would like to install Anaconda without any hassles, I'd recommend an older, stable release if the newer versions have unresolved bugs in their Windows versions. They can be found in the Anaconda Installer Archive [here](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/). 
This particular project was developed using Anaconda3 v4.4 for Windows.

Also recommended - the [Spyder IDE](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/spyder) - comes bundled with anaconda

You'll also need to install the following Python packages - links to conda installation commands provided : [OpenCV3](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/opencv), [Keras](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/keras)
