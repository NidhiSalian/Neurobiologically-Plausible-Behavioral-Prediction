If you're working with Python for Deep Learning on Windows and would like to install Anaconda without any hassles, I'd recommend an older, stable release if the newer versions have unresolved bugs in their Windows versions. They can be found in the Anaconda Installer Archive [here](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/). 
This particular project was developed using Anaconda3 v4.4 for Windows.
Also recommended - the [Spyder IDE](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/spyder) - comes bundled with anaconda
